## Goal
This group is a space for individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations to share their experiences and support each other in using Clojure for data & science projects. 

Data analytics, machine learning, AI, data engineering, scientific computing, and data visualization are all welcome.

It is a safe space for sharing successes, troubles, problems, hopes, and doubts. 

## Participating

:star: It is never too late to join this group. :star:

If you wish to use Clojure for a data or science project and prefer not to be alone in that journey, this group is for you.

We will also assume that you either know some Clojure or have a serious intention to learn it.

To join, please reach out to us by contacting [Daniel Slutsky](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/pm-with/138175-Daniel-Slutsky) at [the Clojurians Zulip chat](../../chat), or ar the various [Scicloj ways of contact](../../contact). 
We will think together about whether this group fits your path.

## Sessions
As a group, we will have biweekly sessions to discuss our ongoing projects. Participants will bring their own data & science problems to the sessions and actively work on them between sessions.

Some of the time will be dedicated to learning relevant practices, ideas, and technical topics.

We will also have one-on-one or small-group sessions to support individual journeys.

### Recordings
The sessions will be partially recorded.

Most of the recordings will not be shared publicly but rather internally as a tool for us to catch up and recall our past discussions. When recordings are planned to be made public, we will first check with all participants.

## Pairing
In the group, we will seek opportunities of collaborations.

A scientist may wish to pair with a Clojure engineer and explore something together, a Clojurian person may be curious about joining a scientific project, etc. We will be looking for such cases and try to help in matching them.

## Contributing
In your projects using the emerging Clojure stack, there will often be opportunities to contribute back to the libraries you use. We will encourage that and help you in considering about fruitful directions and connecting with the relevant library authors. 

We will highly encourage contributing documentation and tutorials and will use the [Clojure Data Scrapbook](https://scicloj.github.io/clojure-data-scrapbook/) as a central space for such content.

## Chat
The group will use [the Clojurians Zulip chat](../../chat). Specifically, the [#real-world-data](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/315077-real-world-data) stream.

## Old timeline (archive)
* Feb. 25th 2022 - two special sessions we had a while back - [announcement](https://clojureverse.org/t/real-world-data-meetup-1/) (recorded but never published)
* late June 2023 - initial survey (then the project went on hold)
* March 2024 - starting the group's regular path
