Jointprob is a study community for probabilistic modeling and Bayesian statistics, running since August 2022.

Even though the community was initiated by [Scicloj](https://scicloj.github.io/) -- a community for data science in Clojure -- this study community is not focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it is open to people of diverse technical backgrounds and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.

As of August 2024, we are planning to renew the meetings after a break of a few months.

## Goal

This is a long-term project aiming to create a space for Bayesian practitioners, as well as aspiring ones, to learn & explore together and support each other.

We wish to be inclusive to people of diverse backgrounds and thus create a common ground where we can broaden our perspectives and inspire each other.

## Joining

It is never too late to join us -- we will help you to catch up.

Please use the [Joining Jointprob form](https://bit.ly/joining-jointprob) to join the community, to be added to our calendar events, or to update your preferences and personal information.

Also, you are always invited to [write to us](./#contact).

## Past Agenda
In the past, we have been meeting biweekly (in groups) to discuss our joint reading and projects.

Our joint reading journeys have been around the first half of [Statistical Rethinking](https://www.routledge.com/Statistical-Rethinking-A-Bayesian-Course-with-Examples-in-R-and-STAN/McElreath/p/book/9780367139919/) by Richard McElreath, and then around [Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python](https://bayesiancomputationbook.com/welcome.html) by Osvaldo A. Martin, Ravin Kumar and Junpeng Lao.

## Present Agenda
As of August 2024, we are planning to begin a new reading journey around [Regression and Other Stories](https://avehtari.github.io/ROS-Examples/) by Andrew Gelman, Jennifer Hill, and Aki Vehtari

## Calendar events
Please refer to the [Joining](./#joining) section to join our calendar events.

## Chat

The community uses Zulip, an open-source chat platform. In some other groups we've been running, we've found it useful for chat, in-depth discussion threads, and knowledge management.

Our Zulip organization is [jointprob.zulipchat.com](https://jointprob.zulipchat.com/).

You may wish to learn a little bit about the concepts of [Zulip streams and topics](https://zulipchat.com/help/about-streams-and-topics). Note that all streams and topics (and even single messages) have URLs, that you can open at separate tabs in your browser.

It would be wonderful to present yourself at the [personal intros](https://jointprob.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/331546-personal-intros) stream, preferably as a new topic thread.

## Video platform

For video meetings, we currently use Zoom. The link is shared in the [calendar events](./#calendar-events).

## Recordings

Some parts of the sessions are recorded and shared internally in the Zulip chat. Possibly, we will also share some recorded parts publicly.

## Projects

Participants take on projects as individuals or in small groups.

Example projects:
* read an article and share it with the group
* reimplement an example we have learned using a different technology
* explore a dataset with the methods learned

## Recommended background

Participants are assumed to have some relevant knowledge. 

To appreciate the content we are studying, it is recommended to have the following:
- basic knowledge of probability and statistics (say, college-level intro courses)
- programming experience in any language (a few months)
- experience exploring data
- an open mind

If you are not sure whether this journey fits your background, please [write to us](./#contact). We can think together.

## Principles

The following core principles are typical of Scicloj study groups.
 
**No experts**. We do not assume that anybody is an expert in the field. We come to learn together with a student mindset.

**A clear path**. We will be very thoughtful about the agenda and where we wish to go. We will continually rethink and adapt our pathway going there.

**Confused together**. It is just fine to be confused. We will be there together and seek clarity together.

**Being active**. We encourage members to learn independently and take on projects. In a sense, its purpose is (also) to support those individual journeys.

**Mutual curiosity**. We make serious efforts to be inclusive to participants of various backgrounds. The different perspectives of our friends are part of what we wish to learn.
