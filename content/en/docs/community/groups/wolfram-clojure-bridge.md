This 2022 group has been discussing the usage and development of [the bridge to Wolfram Language](https://github.com/scicloj/clojuratica).

We used to meet on the last Thursday of every month, and spend the time with overviews of new developments, discussion of language design and library design, and explorations of the Wolfram Language ecosystem.

Though the regular group meetings have been discontinued, the work and discussion of [Wolframite](https://github.com/scicloj/wolframite/) are ongoing. See the [#wolfram-clojure-bridge](https://clojurians.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/313853-wolfram-clojure-bridge) stream at the [Clojurians Zulip chat](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/chat/).

For more background about the project, please see the [Dec. 5th 2021 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqoUeFOSNjQ) of Pawel Ceranka.
