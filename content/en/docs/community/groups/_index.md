Some parts of the Scicloj activity are driven by regular meetings in various groups.

Some of these meetings are public and shared at the [Clojure calendar feed](https://clojureverse.org/t/the-clojure-events-calendar-feed-turns-2/). Some study groups such as [Jointprob](./jointprob) have their own spaces for sharing events.
