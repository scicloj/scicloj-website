Scicloj offers mentoring to Clojurians who wish to become active in open-source projects.

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-2" href="/docs/community/contact/" role="button">Please reach out</a>

## What is that?

One of the big challenges of getting involved in open source is gaining a sense of relevance: are the features you are working on actually valuable?
That is one of the main benefits of collaborating with open-source groups such as Scicloj.

Scicloj offers a clear path to getting involved in open-source tools and libraries, both new and established.

If you know some Clojure and wish to become an open-source contributor or simply want to help us out, this project is for you.

We need your help.

## How does it work?

* We will propose relevant projects that are known to be relevant, useful, and aligned with your knowledge and interests.
* You will pick a project.
* We will meet for 30-60 minutes every 1-2 weeks, depending on your pace and availability.
* We'll assume you can also spend at least 4 hours a week working on your own.

## What backround knowledge is assumed?
This depends on the project. Typically, one year of Clojure programming would be a reasonable background.

## What kinds of projects will we be working on?
A few examples:
* add a function for printing linear regression models in [Fastmath](https://github.com/generateme/fastmath)
* port Java/XML exmaples of [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org/) to Clojure/EDN ones for [scicloj.ml.tribuo](https://github.com/scicloj/scicloj.ml.tribuo)
* contribute docstrings and unit tests to [dtype-next](https://github.com/cnuernber/dtype-next)
* test Clojure libraries on existing benchmarks
* add support for data formats (e.g. Zarr, Avro) conversion for [tech.ml.dataset](https://github.com/techascent/tech.ml.dataset)
* build a [Kindly](https://scicloj.github.io/kindly-noted/) adapter for [Clojupyter](https://github.com/clojupyter/clojupyter)
* improve the Clojure integration in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
* [translate a book chapter](https://github.com/scicloj/translating-books) to Clojure
* look into early-stage libraries such as [cmdstan-clj](https://github.com/scicloj/cmdstan-clj), try them out, discover problems, and improve

##  What would I benefit from participating?
* Enriching your public profile as a developer with open-source activity.
* Gradually learning about the internals of fascinating Clojure libraries.
* Practicing the soft skills needed for remote, async collaboration in distributed teams across time zones.
* Gaining visible evidence for such communication and dev skills.
* Weekly interaction with experienced Clojurians.
* Opportunities to propose talks for conferences and prepare them with the support of the Scicloj group.
