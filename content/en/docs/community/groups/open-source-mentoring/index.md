Scicloj offers mentoring to Clojurians who wish to become active in open-source projects.

<a class="btn btn-primary btn-lg px-4 mb-2" href="/docs/community/contact/" role="button">Please reach out</a>

## What is that?

One of the big challenges of getting involved in open source is gaining a sense of relevance: are the features you are working on actually valuable?
That is one of the main benefits of collaborating with open-source groups such as Scicloj.

Scicloj offers a clear path to getting involved in open-source tools and libraries, both new and established.

If you know some Clojure and wish to become an open-source contributor or simply want to help us out, this project is for you.

We need your help.

## How does it work?

* We will propose relevant projects that are known to be relevant, useful, and aligned with your knowledge and interests.
* You will pick a project.
* We will meet for 30-60 minutes every 1-2 weeks, depending on your pace and availability.
* We'll assume you can also spend at least 4 hours a week working on your own.

## What background knowledge is assumed?
This depends on the project. Typically, one year of Clojure programming would be a reasonable background.

## What kinds of projects will we be working on?
See the [list of projects](https://github.com/scicloj/open-source-mentoring/blob/main/list-of-projects.md) for a few examples we may propose.

## Who are the mentors I may meet?
Here is the [list of mentors](https://github.com/scicloj/open-source-mentoring/blob/main/list-of-mentors.md).

The assignment of a mentor will depend on the nature of the project you are working on, among other things.

##  What would I benefit from participating?
* Enriching your public profile as a developer with open-source activity.
* Gradually learning about the internals of fascinating Clojure libraries.
* Practicing the soft skills needed for remote, async collaboration in distributed teams across time zones.
* Gaining visible evidence for such communication and dev skills.
* Weekly interaction with experienced Clojurians.
* Opportunities to propose talks for conferences and prepare them with the support of the Scicloj group.

## Where can I find more information?

We will gradually collect the relevant resources under
[scicloj](https://github.com/scicloj) /
