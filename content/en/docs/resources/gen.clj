;; Idea: move towards data driven representation of libraries.
;;
;; Goals:
;;
;;   - Allow editing library data as plain data
;;   - Allow others to build alternative views of the library data

;; Inspired by metadata management on play.teod.eu:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To supplement our opinionated discussions of the ecosystem, here is a less-opinionated, plain list of relevant libraries written by Clojurians. Not all libraries mentioned here are affiliated with Scicloj, but we seek to be in dialogue with library authors as much as possible.

Do you know about anything relevant that is missing here? - [Let us talk](../../community/contact)!

For every library, we mark whether it is actively developed (`act`), and whether it is still experimental (`exp`).
A star (:star:) means that we know the library to be actively used and useful.

We tag libraries with the field they are relevant to.
"
     ;; probably a good idea to sort these tags
     ;;
     ;; But I'm keeping 1-1 compatibility with the published stuff for now,
     ;; don't want to refactor + change spec at the same time.
     (tags-list model)
     ;; we simply print the other links
     "
## Other lists :link:
These other lists of libraries are very relevant to the emerging Clojure data science stack:
- [Clojurelog](https://clojurelog.github.io/) :star: by the XTDB team - a comparison of various Clojure-Datalog databases
- [Clojure DSL resources](https://github.com/simongray/clojure-dsl-resources) :star: by Simon Gray - a curated list of mostly mature and/or actively developed Clojure resources relevant for dealing with domain-specific languages, in particular parsing and data transformation with/of DSLs.
- [Clojure graph resources](https://github.com/simongray/clojure-graph-resources) :star: by Simon Gray - a curated list of mostly mature and/or actively developed Clojure resources relevant for dealing with graph-like data
