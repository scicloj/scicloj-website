Now that the Clojure stack for scientific computing is [maturing rapidly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D5d6Ls6pBw), the [Scicloj group](https://scicloj.github.io/) is looking at ways of reaching other communities.

One avenue would be to consider publishing academic papers about the ecosystem: regarding individual libraries or outlining the ecosystem as a whole. Another avenue, is that the Scicloj group would like to encourage and help out with research projects themselves.

In the second half of November, we will have an initial planning meeting to discuss possible challenges and opportunities.

If you are either a researcher (academic or independent) or an open-source practitioner of a relevant project, we could use your insights in that conversation. Even if you are currently planning to use other technologies for your own research, and simply wish to help Clojure with your advice, that would be much appreciated.

Update: Following [the poll](https://tallycal.com/p/4170400), we weel meet at 5:30 pm UTC Nov. 25th 2024. The official part of the meeting will be 60 minutes long. A few of us may stay and chat afterwards.

Of course, [please write to us](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/contact/) any questions or ideas you may have.

Looking forward to seeing you,

Thomas Clark and Daniel Slusky
