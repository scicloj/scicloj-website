The [Clojurists Together](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/) organisation has decided [to sponsor](https://www.clojuriststogether.org/news/q1-2024-funding-announcement/) Scicloj community building for Q1 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky. The project is taking place in February, March, and April 2024. Here is Daniel's update for March.

You may see the previous one - the February update - [here](../clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-february-2024-update/).

Comments and ideas would help. :pray:
