Recently, a few of us at Scicloj have had enlightening discussions of of current state of the machine learning landscape in Clojure. This post is my attempt to distill it into a summary for the community&amp;rsquo;s benefit, so more people can understand where things are at and what the active developers in this space are working on.</description></item><item><title>Clojurists Together project - Scicloj community building - March 2024 update</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-march-2024-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/clojurists-together-project-scicloj-community-building-march-2024-update/</guid><description>The Clojurists Together organisation has decided to sponsor Scicloj community building for Q1 2024, as a project by Daniel Slutsky.

This series was inpired by a few other projects in the Clojure community, such as Rupert&amp;rsquo;s initiative to work on models that may work well with Clojure language tasks, the related #clojurellm channel that was created by John Newman and Rupert, and the various libraries for LLMs and related services, that have been keep emerging mostly during 2023.</description></item><item><title>Jointprob community updates - Probability Basics talk, Hierarchical Models followup</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/jointprob-community-updates-probability-basics-talk-hierarchical-models-followup/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Sep 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/jointprob-community-updates-probability-basics-talk-hierarchical-models-followup/</guid><description>‚≠ê TL;DR: See you at the September standalone talk of the Jointprob &amp;ndash; an intro to Probability basics.

As ML requires a lot of different trying of code, models and hyper-parameters, we need to have a tools which keeps track of this.
These type of tools can be programming language independent, as they see the code (whatever code) such as one of the assets to track (among hyper-parameters, performance metrics and data)</description></item><item><title>Hello üëã</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/hello/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/blog/hello/</guid><description>A few informative posts are coming soon, to help in clarifying the situation of the emerging Clojure data-centric stack.</description></item></channel></rss>
