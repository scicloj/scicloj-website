The details below are tentative and will probably change.

Even though the community was initiated by Scicloj &amp;ndash; a community for data science in Clojure &amp;ndash; this study community is not focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it is open to people of diverse technical backgrounds and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.</description></item><item><title>{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</guid><description>This group has been renamed as jointprob.</description></item><item><title>visual-tools: regular updates &amp; discussions around building visual tooling</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/visual-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/visual-tools/</guid><description>The goal of this group is to create collaborations in learning and building Clojure tools for data visualization and literate programming.
The authors of several actively developed tools are involved (Chlorine, Clover, Calva and its Notebooks, Portal, Viscous, Sidebar, Nette, Fabricate, Omni-trace, Oz, Saite, Notespace, Clay, Goldly, Saturn, clt-tiles, Obsidian Wielder, Cardigan Bay, Platypub, Data Rabbit, Clerk, Klipse, etc.).

When we meet, we spend the time with overviews of new developments, discussion of language design and library design, and explorations of the Wolfram Language ecosystem.
For more background about the project, please see the Dec. 5th 2021 talk of the maintainer, Pawel Ceranka.
Organizer: Pawel Ceranka (please reach out to prnc at the Clojurians Zulip)
Time of meetings: Last Thurdsday of every month, at 18:00 UTC</description></item><item><title>{on hold} ml-study: practicing the use of the emerging stack</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ml-study/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/ml-study/</guid><description>(this group is on hold)
The ml-study group has been a space for regular meetings for practicing the usage of the emerging Clojure data science stack.
It has been serving us not only in learning, but also in testing the emerging stack and creating a collection of usage examples.
Organizer: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the Clojurians Zulip)
Chat stream: #ml-study</description></item><item><title>{on hold} real-world-data: discussions of real-world data problems</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/</guid><description>(this group is on hold)
The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for real-world data problems.
The goal is to create a space where individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations are able to share their experiences in using Clojure for data-centric projects. Data analytics, machine learning, AI, data engineering, scientific computing, and data visualization are all welcome.
We want it to be a safe space, that would be comfortable for sharing successes, troubles, problems, hopes, and doubts.</description></item><item><title>{on hold} sci-fu: regular discussions of various dev projects</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/sci-fu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/sci-fu/</guid><description>(this group is on hold)
The sci-fu (Scicloj foundations) has been a space for regular discussions of various dev projects.
In a sense, it is a study group where we learn how to contribute to the ecosystem &amp;ndash; For a few of us, sci-fu has been a place to discuss our first steps as open-source contributors.
In another sense, it is a dev group where we discuss common priorities, share our progress and challenges, and explore future directions.</description></item><item><title>{on hold} sicmutils: studying the sicmutils library, physics, and geometry</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/sicmutils/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/sicmutils/</guid><description>(this group is on hold)
The sicmutils group has been studying the Sicmutils computer algebra system and the SICM book, and discussing various projects by group members around the topics of math and physics in Clojure.
Its explorations have affected the development of some of our tools and libraries for data-visualization and literate programming, among other things.
Organizer: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the Clojurians Zulip)
Typical time of meetings: ad hoc meetings by group members' initiatives</description></item></channel></rss>
