The details below are tentative and will probably change.

The goal of this series of meetups is to support our learning, as a community, of the new landscape of ideas around large language models.
Some of the content here is specific to the Clojure ecosystem (e.g., discussing the use of LLMs from Clojure), but many parts of it could be helpful and interesting to broader audiences.

Even though the community was initiated by Scicloj &amp;ndash; a community for data science in Clojure &amp;ndash; this study community is not focused on any single technology or programming language. Rather, it is open to people of diverse technical backgrounds and will continually seek dialogue and mutual inspiration across languages and technologies.</description></item><item><title>{renamed} probabilistic modelling study group</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/probabilistic-modelling-study-group/</guid><description>This group has been renamed as jointprob.</description></item><item><title>real-world-data: a space to discuss your data and science projects in Clojure</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/</guid><description>The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for data and science problems.
Schedule #
The group will start meeting regularly on Fridays, 17:00 UTC time zone.
March 22th, 2024 - meeting 1 - ðŸ“† event Goal #
This group is a space for individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations to share their experiences and support each other in using Clojure for data &amp;amp; science projects.
Data analytics, machine learning, AI, data engineering, scientific computing, and data visualization are all welcome.</description></item><item><title>visual-tools: regular updates &amp; discussions around building visual tooling</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/visual-tools/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/visual-tools/</guid><description>ðŸ“…Follow our meetings on the Clojure Calendar FeedðŸ“…
The goal of this group is to create collaborations in learning and building Clojure tools data visualization, literate programming, and UI design.
The authors of several actively developed tools are involved (Chlorine, Clover, Calva and its Notebooks, Portal, Viscous, Sidebar, Nette, Fabricate, Omni-trace, Oz, Saite, Notespace, Clay, Claykind, Goldly, Saturn, clt-tiles, Obsidian Wielder, Cardigan Bay, Platypub, Data Rabbit, Clerk, Mosaic, MetaREPL, Meyvn, etc.</description></item><item><title>wolfram-clojure-bridge: discussing the usage and development of the bridge to Wolfram Language</title><link>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/wolfram-clojure-bridge/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/wolfram-clojure-bridge/</guid><description>The wolfram-clojure-bridge discusses the usage and development of the bridge to Wolfram Language.
When we meet, we spend the time with overviews of new developments, discussion of language design and library design, and explorations of the Wolfram Language ecosystem.
For more background about the project, please see the Dec. 5th 2021 talk of the maintainer, Pawel Ceranka.

The ml-study group has been a space for regular meetings for practicing the usage of the emerging Clojure data science stack.
It has been serving us not only in learning, but also in testing the emerging stack and creating a collection of usage examples.
Organizer: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the Clojurians Zulip)
