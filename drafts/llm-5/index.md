In May 2023, Scicloj started organizing [a series of meetups](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/community/groups/llm-meetups/) around Large Language Models.

This series was inpired by a few other projects in the Clojure community, such as Rupert's [initiative](https://github.com/ruped?tab=repositories) to work on models that may work well with Clojure language tasks, the related `#clojurellm` channel that was created by John Newman and Rupert, and [the various libraries](https://scicloj.github.io/docs/resources/libs/#large-language-models-and-related-services) for LLMs and related services, that have been keep emerging mostly during 2023.

This post discusses the journey of the meetups so far, mostly the panel we had in the fifth meetup. It also anticipates some of the coming meetups in the near future.
