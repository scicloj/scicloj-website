We may possibly help in finding a nice way to begin.\nJoin our dev and study groups #\rScicloj is organizing a few dev groups and study groups that meet regularly to learn, to brainstorm, and to create. Your perspective could be helpful there.\nShare your experience #\rHearing about your personal workflow, data stories, problems and ideas can be valuable to others. Just open a new topic at one of the other relevant chat streams, and share your thoughts.\nWrite a tutorial #\rWriting tutorials (either small or big) about working with data is central to our process. The importance is twofold: sharing realistic experiences, and realizing what may be missing or could be improved in our stack. You may just pick an existing tutorial and translate it to Clojure. Or, you can pick some fresh new data and start analysing them from scratch.\nJoin the organizing team #\rAre you interested in the human aspects of growing the community? Or, do you want to be involved in the thought process about the goals and priorities of this community? Then the scicloj organizing team would welcome you to join. Even if your time is limited, contributing your thought can be important.\nPair with a library author #\rLibrary authors need users. Some of the actively developed libraries would benefit a lot from a user trying to use them and sharing their findings.\nHelp building the website and knowledge base #\rThe scicloj website would love to have more people involved in it. Contributing to the content organization, writing opinionated blog posts, helping with the aesthetics \u0026ndash; all would be welcome.\nCreate some proof of concept #\rDo you think that something is missing in our stack? Then let us maybe create it! Beginning with a small proof of concept, you can test the idea with other community members. If you suggest your idea, maybe someone will be happy to join you, and you create it together.\nContribute to a library #\rIs there any library that you are curious to learn about or just want to help building? Then a good way to learn may be to contribute. This may be some help in adding a feature, adding some tests, or writing documentation. You can offer that to the library author. Some would be happy and might offer a nice way to begin.\nSubmit an issue #\rHave you found a bug or a missing feature? Probably, the maintainers of actively developed libraries would be happy to know about it. Usually, the project Issues page or the project Zulip stream would be the place to do that.

It is an online study group about probabilistic modelling, open to people of diverse technical backgrounds.\nAs of Feb. 2022, we are still checking the possibility of organizing this group, hoping to decide and possibly begin in the coming weeks.\nYour response to ⭐ the survey ⭐ would help a lot in our planning.\nThe details below are tentative and will probably change following your feedback and community discussions.\nAgenda #\rWe will begin by learning one introductory book, probably Think Bayes 2 by Allen B. Downey.\nThen, we will proceed with more advanced books and articles.\nThis field of statistics is tightly related to programming, and during our learning we will look into different languages and libraries for Bayesian computing and probabilistic programming.\nIn parallel to the main path of learning, we will encourage individual and small-group projects, and will continuously share our progress with each other.\nSessions #\rWe will meet once in two weeks to learn together for two hours. The first hour will be dedicated to following our main path of study (e.g., the current book chapter being read). In the second hour, we will share our progress with the projects, and explore further.\nIn between these main sessions, we will encourage ad-hoc sessions to explore specialized topics or practice further.\nRecordings #\rSome parts of the sessions will be recorded and shared with the group. Possibly, some parts of the recordings will be made public.\nProjects #\rParticipants will take on projects as individuals or small groups.\nExample project:\n read an article and share it with the group reimplement an example we\u0026rsquo;ve learned using a different programming language or different library explore a dataset with the methods learned  Assumed background #\rWe will probably assume some background in programming, math, and statistics. The assumptions here will depend on your feedback on the survey and community discussions.\nPrinciples #\rThe following core principles are typical to Scicloj study groups.\nNo experts. We do not assume that anybody in the group is an expert in the field. We come to learn together with a student mindset.\nA clear path. We will be very thoughtful about the agenda and about where we wish to go. We will continuously rethink and adapt our path going there.\nConfused together. It is just fine to be confused. We will be there together and seek clarity together.\nBeing active. The group encourages its members to learn independently and take on projects. In a sense, its purpose is (also) to support those individual journeys.\nMutual curiosity. We make serious efforts to be inclusive to participants of various backgrounds. The different perspectives of our friends are part of what we wish to learn.\nWhy is Scicloj organizing this Group #\rScicloj is an open-source group working on a stack of tools and libraries for data science using the Clojure programming language.\nA few of us care a lot about the probabilistic/Bayesian paradigm and find it a promising approach in general\nMoreover, We believe there are some common core ideas in common between Clojure, the programming language, and Bayesian Statistics, the scientific method. They both seek simple, coherent, and conceptually clear solutions to problems, and they both dare to diverge from mainstream approaches in order to achieve that.\nThe Scicloj approach to building a data science stack is based on building bridges to other languages and ecosystems. This seems compatible with the spirit of the Bayesian community and its subcommunities, where different technological flavors respect and learn from each other.\nCreating a polyglot study group \u0026ndash; one where different programming languages and styles of thinking meet to learn together \u0026ndash; is also a way to challenge ourselves to learn more about other ecosystems, and hopefully encourage friends from those ecosystems to be curious about Clojure.\n"}).add({id:8,href:"/docs/community/groups/",title:"Dev \u0026 study groups",description:"The various dev groups and study groups organized by Scicloj",content:"Some parts of the Scicloj activity are driven by regular meetings in various groups.\n"}).add({id:9,href:"/docs/community/groups/ml-study/",title:"ml-study",description:"The ml-study group",content:"(this group is on hold, as of Feb. 2022 \u0026ndash; hoping to come back in the near future)\nThe ml-study group has been a space for regular meetings about practicing the usage of the emerging Clojure data science stack.\nIt has been serving us not only in learning, but also in testing the emerging stack and creating a collection of usage examples.\nOrganizer: Daniel Slutsky (please reach out at the Clojurians Zulip)\nTypical time of meetings: on hold at the moment\nChat stream: #ml-study\n"}).add({id:10,href:"/docs/community/groups/real-world-data/",title:"real-world-data",description:"The real-world-data group",content:"The real-world-data group is about the use of Clojure for real-world data problems.\nThe goal is to create a space where individuals, companies, academic groups, and organizations are able to share their experiences in using Clojure for data-centric projects.
